										She then attended dental school at the University of Southern California (USC) School of Dentistry and was
										awarded the Floyde E. Hogeboom Award for Outstanding Achievement in Pediatric Dentistry.
										After volunteering in various mobile clinics, Dr. Christine’s interest in pediatric oral care grew
										and she went on to receive her speciality degree in Pediatric Dentistry from UCLA.
										Through a mutual patient, Dr. Christine met Dr. Howard.
										Due to Dr. Howard’s persistence and charm, she eventually fell in love with him.
										As the saying goes, the rest is history!</p>

									<p>Dr. Christine loves talking and interacting with children.
										Her specialty is making sure children are comfortable and relaxed during treatment.

										From infants to adolescents, Dr. Christine hopes to make an impact on oral health and
										keep her patients smiling into adulthood.</p>
									<p>In her free time, Dr. Christine is an avid foodie that loves to try new restaurants.

									<h3>Howard Chu, DMD, MS</h3>
									<p>Dr. Chu attended Harvard University, where he graduated with honors and served as the
										president of his class. He was then selected to attend the elite three year Orthodontics
										Residency program at UCLA, where he would eventually meet Dr. Christine through a mutual
										patient. During his time at UCLA, Dr. Chu served as chief resident and became a board-certified
										specialist in orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics. Dr. Chu is a published author and
										has presented his research to international audiences. </p>

									<p>Dr. Chu grew up in Chandler, AZ where he attended the prestigious Barrett Honors College
										at the Arizona State University. During his time at ASU, Dr. Chu served as president and
										founder of the Health Care Coalition, the largest student health care organization on campus.</p>

									<p>His love for connecting with people as well as helping each patient achieve their
										individual goals is what drove him to open his own practice with Dr. Christine.
										For Dr. Chu, the best part of being an orthodontist is working with every patient
										in creating the most beautiful smile in the most efficient way. </p>
									<p>In his free time, Dr. Chu enjoys staying active and healthy.
										He is an avid crossfitter and enjoys olympic weightlifting.
										As a new father, Dr. Chu loves teaching his 1-year old son,
										Blake, how to say “ba-ba”. Ask him anything about orthodontics
										and he’ll be more than happy to provide an informative and straightforward
										explanation. </p>

										<h2>What is a Pediatric Dentist?</h2>
										<p> A pediatric dentist has an additional two to three years of specialized training
											after dental school, and is dedicated to the oral health of children from infancy
											through the teenage years including those with special needs. The very young, pre-teens,
											and teenagers all need different approaches in dealing with their behavior, guiding
											their dental growth and development, and helping them avoid future dental problems. The
											pediatric dentist is best qualified to meet these needs.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="pediatrics-content services">
										<h2>Services</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<h4>First Visit</h4>
											</li>
											<li><h4>Infant Oral Care / Teething</h4></li>
											<li>
												<h4>Preventive Dentistry</h4>
												<p>This includes proper brushing,
													flossing and eating habits, ideal fluoride
													levels and the use of pit and fissure sealants.
													We strive to provide a fun, educational environment
													 where children learn about the importance of
													 good oral hygiene.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Restorative Dentistry</h4>
												<p>
													This includes children’s fillings, crowns and prostheses.
													We are committed to discussing all options before these

												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Sedation Dentistry</h4>
												<p>
													Sedation dentistry refers to the use of sedation during dental treatment.
													Sedation is most commonly used during extensive procedures,
													for patients with dental phobia, or for patients who find it
													difficult to sit still. There are different types of sedation,
													 including nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”), oral conscious sedation,
													 and general anesthesia.
												</p>
											</li>
										</ul>

									<div class="pediatrics-content faq">
										<h2>FAQ</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<h4>When should my child visit the dentist for the first time?</h4>
												<p>The AAPD (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry) and AAP
													(American Academy of Pediatrics) recommend that your child
													visit the dentist by your child’s first birthday, or when their
													first tooth erupts. This first visit rarely requires more than
													a basic checkup, and is focused on helping your child feel
													comfortable at the dentist’s office, preventing tooth decay,
													and teaching you the best way to care for your child’s teeth.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Why does my child need to visit a pediatric dentist?</h4>
												<p>Pediatric dentists are specialists who have received 2
													additional years of training focused on dental care for
													children. This gives them the skills they need to build
													trusting relationships with their patients and a unique
													understanding of infant and child dental health needs.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Preventive Dentistry</h4>
												<p>This includes proper brushing,
													flossing and eating habits, ideal fluoride
													levels and the use of pit and fissure sealants.
													We strive to provide a fun, educational environment
													 where children learn about the importance of
													 good oral hygiene.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Why are baby teeth important?</h4>
												<p>
													Baby teeth are important for 2 reasons.
													They help you child chew and speak properly,
													and they act as placeholders for the adult teeth.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>What is the best way to care for my child’s teeth?</h4>
												<p>
													It is critical that your child learns how to properly
													care for his or her teeth. Before your child is old
													enough to take care of his or her own oral hygiene,
													you will need to take care of their teeth for them.
												</p>
												<p>
													Before the baby teeth erupt, use a clean, damp cloth
													to gently wipe down your baby’s gums. This will keep
													them clean and remove plaque. After the teeth have
													erupted, use a soft-bristled toothbrush. When you child
													is able to spit out toothpaste, you can begin using
													toothpaste in pea-sized amounts. We recommend that
													you use a fluoridated toothpaste. You can begin
													flossing when two adjacent teeth have contact.
												</p>
												<p>
													Your child will be able to brush by themselves
													at about age 8, or when they can tie their own
													shoelaces.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>How do I prevent tooth decay?</h4>
												<p>
													The best way to prevent dental decay is by
													practicing good oral hygiene. Help your child
													brush and floss, and teach them how to brush
													and floss themselves when they are old enough
													(about age 8).
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>How do I break thumb-sucking and pacifier habits in my child?</h4>
												<p>
													Thumb-sucking and pacifier-sucking habits are common in
													infants. Children will usually give up these habits on
													their own as they age. If these habits continue after
													the permanent teeth erupt, they can cause damage to
													your child’s teeth and oral health. If this is the
													case for your child, please visit our orthodontist,
													 Dr. Howard Chu. We can recommend several ideas as
													 well as providing a habit-breaking appliance to
													 help your child stop his or her finger or
													 pacifier-sucking habit.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>What are dental sealants?</h4>
												<p>
													Dental sealants are a preventive treatment applied to the molars.
													They work to protect your teeth against cavities, bacteria,
													 and other factors that contribute to decay and disease.
													 Sealants do not replace brushing and flossing. They just
													 act as an extra layer of protection for the teeth. Please
													 contact our office for more information about dental
													 sealants, and to schedule your child’s consultation
													 with our dentist.
												</p>
											</li>

											<li>
												<h4>Are dental x-rays safe?</h4>
												<p>
													Yes. Dental x-rays produce extremely low amounts of radiation – in fact,
													they produce less radiation than what you are exposed to in your
													day-to-day life. Dental x-rays are typically taken once a year.
													They are used by our dentist to view your teeth and supporting
													structures, giving us a better understanding of your overall
													oral health, and helping us detect cavities or other problems
													and plan more efficient treatments.
												</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<div class="pediatrics-content emergencies">
										<h2>Emergencies</h2>
										<p>Here are some proven suggestions for some of the most frequent dental emergencies*:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<h4>Cut Or Bitten Tongue, Lip Or Cheek:</h4>
												<p>Apply ice to the injured area.
													If there is bleeding, apply firm pressure with a clean cloth.
													 If bleeding does not stop after 15 minutes or it cannot be
													 controlled by simple pressure, take your child to the nearest
														hospital emergency room.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Knocked Out Permanent Tooth:</h4>
												<p>First, you should try to find the missing tooth.
													Once found, handle the tooth carefully by the
													crown (the top part), not the root portion
													(the portion normally unseen). You may gently
													rinse the tooth, but minimize any unnecessary
													 handling as this may damage the tooth. Inspect
													 the tooth for any broken or cracked areas. If the
													 child will tolerate it and the tooth is without damage,
														try to reinsert it in the socket. Have the patient
														hold the tooth in place by biting on a piece of
														sterile gauze. Call our office immediately and
														alert us. Your child will need to be seen as soon
														as possible. If you cannot reinsert the tooth, transport
														the tooth in a cup containing the patient’s saliva
														or milk.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Knocked Out Baby Tooth: </h4>
												<p>Call us at the office and examine
													for any associated injuries of the
													lip or soft tissues. Clean injured
													 areas with water and apply a cold
													 compress.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<h4>Possible Broken Or Fractured Jaw: </h4>
												<p>Keep the jaw from moving and take your child to the nearest hospital emergency room.
												</p>
											</li>
											<blockquote>
												*When in doubt, don’t hesitate to call us at 626- or 911.
												These suggestions are in no way intended to replace proper
												 medical or dental care and advice.
